   ~GPU:-A Gaphics processing unit(GPU) is a specialized processor designed to handle and accelerate the rendering of images, video and animation. unlike a CPU,which is 
               optimised for general-purpose computing task, a GPU is optimized for parllel processing,meaning it can handle many operations simultaneously.

   ~TPU:-A tensor processing unit(TPU) is a specialized type of processor designed by google specifically for accelerating machine learning task,particularly those
               involving tensor computations. Tensor are multimensional arrays used in various machine learning and artificial intelligence models.

   ~QPU:-A quantum processing unit(QPU) is a spcialized type of processor designed to perform quantum computations. unlike classical processor, which use bits to represent 
               data as 0s and 1s, aQPU uses quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to quantum superposition.

   ~ASIC:-ASIC stands for Application-Specific integrated circuit. it's a type of integrated circuit designed for a specific application or function, rather than general
                puerpose use. for example, an ASIC designed for cryptocurrency mining is specifically built to perform the hashing calculations required for mining.

 6. # **BLOCKCHAIN:**

 Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger technology that securely records transactions across multiple computers in a way that       prevents alteration or tampering. It operates as a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions. Once a block is added to   the chain, it is difficult to change any information in that block without altering all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus  from the network. This makes blockchain a transparent and secure method for managing and verifying transactions. It's commonly used in  cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but also has applications in various other fields, such as supply chain management, voting systems, and   smart contracts.

12.**IP ADDRESS**

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique string of numbers separated by periods or colons that identifies each device connected to a network. IP addresses serve two primary functions: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the host in the network. They are essential for routing internet traffic and ensuring data reaches the correct destination.

![image alt](https://github.com/Gautam-io-dev/Basic-Computer-Science-Keywords/blob/947a68ef5d4b4142dcddc9c582640da4cbbf1d0c/Image%2013.jpeg)

There are two main versions of IP address:


1️⃣IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4): This format uses four sets of numbers ranging from 0 to 255, separated by periods 

(e.g., 192.168.1.1). It provides about 4.3 billion unique addresses.

2️⃣IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6): This format uses eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons 

(e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). It provides a vastly larger number of addresses to accommodate the growing number of devices on the internet.

13.**ISP(Internet Service Provider)**

An ISP, or Internet Service Provider, is a company or organization that provides individuals and businesses with access to the internet. ISPs offer various types of internet connections, including:

- **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)**: Uses telephone lines to provide internet access.
- **Cable**: Uses cable television lines for internet service.
- **Fiber-optic**: Uses fiber-optic cables for high-speed internet access.
- **Satellite**: Provides internet access via satellite signals, useful in remote areas.
- **Wireless**: Uses radio signals to connect to the internet, which can include both fixed wireless and mobile broadband.

In addition to providing internet access, ISPs may also offer related services such as email, web hosting, and technical support. When you connect to the internet, you’re usually connecting through an ISP that assigns you an IP address and handles the routing of data between your device and the broader internet.

14.**DNS(Domain Name System)**

DNS stands for Domain Name System. It functions like a phone book for the internet, translating human-friendly domain names (like `www.example.com`) into IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`) that computers use to identify each other on the network.

Here's a simple breakdown of how DNS works:

1. **Request**: When you type a web address into your browser, a DNS request is made to find the corresponding IP address for that domain name.

2. **Resolution**: The DNS system then looks up the IP address associated with that domain name. This process involves several steps:
   - **Recursive Resolver**: Your request first goes to a DNS resolver, which is often provided by your ISP. This resolver tries to find the IP address for the domain name.
   - **Root Name Servers**: If the resolver doesn't have the address cached, it queries one of the root name servers, which point to the appropriate top-level domain (TLD) name servers (like those for `.com` or `.org`).
   - **TLD Name Servers**: The TLD servers then direct the resolver to the authoritative name servers for the specific domain.
   - **Authoritative Name Servers**: These servers have the actual IP address for the domain and respond to the resolver with this information.

3. **Response**: The DNS resolver returns the IP address to your browser, which then uses it to connect to the web server hosting the website you want to visit.

DNS is crucial for the functionality of the internet, making it easier for people to navigate and access websites without needing to remember complex numerical IP addresses.

15.**VPN(Virtual Private Network)**

A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a service that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. It allows you to access the internet as if you were connected to a private network, providing privacy and security. Here's how it works and why you might use it:

1. **Encryption**: When you connect to a VPN, your internet traffic is encrypted, meaning that the data you send and receive is scrambled and unreadable to anyone who might intercept it. This helps protect your data from hackers, especially on public Wi-Fi networks.

2. **IP Masking**: A VPN hides your real IP address and replaces it with one from the VPN server. This can make it harder for websites, advertisers, and other parties to track your online activities and identify your location.

3. **Secure Access**: VPNs provide secure access to your network resources, which can be useful for businesses allowing remote employees to connect to internal systems securely.

4. **Bypassing Restrictions**: VPNs can help you access content that might be restricted or censored in your location by routing your connection through servers in different countries. This is useful for accessing services, websites, or content that might be geo-blocked.

5. **Privacy**: By hiding your IP address and encrypting your data, a VPN enhances your online privacy, making it more difficult for third parties to monitor your browsing activities.

When you use a VPN, your internet traffic is routed through a secure server before reaching its destination, adding a layer of privacy and security. However, it's important to choose a reputable VPN provider to ensure your data is handled securely and your privacy is protected.

16.**FRONTEND,BACKEND AND API(Application Programming Interface)**

In web development, the terms **frontend**, **backend**, and **API** refer to different aspects of building and managing applications. Here’s a breakdown of each:

### **Frontend**

**Frontend** refers to the **client-side** of a web application. It encompasses everything that users interact with directly in their web browsers. This includes:

- **Design and Layout**: The visual aspects of a website or application, including the layout, colors, fonts, and images.
- **User Interface (UI)**: The components that users interact with, such as buttons, forms, and navigation menus.
- **Technologies**: Frontend development primarily involves languages and frameworks like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. Frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js are commonly used to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

### **Backend**

**Backend** refers to the **server-side** of a web application. It involves everything that happens on the server and is responsible for managing and processing data. Key aspects include:

- **Server**: The hardware or software that provides services, resources, or data to other computers over a network.
- **Database**: Where data is stored, retrieved, and managed. Common databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
- **Server-Side Logic**: The code that runs on the server, handling requests from the frontend, processing data, and sending responses. This includes server-side languages like Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, and Node.js.
- **Authentication**: Managing user login, registration, and security.

### **API**

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs can be used to:

- **Connect Frontend and Backend**: APIs often serve as the bridge between the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). For instance, when you submit a form on a website, the frontend sends a request to the backend via an API, which processes the request and sends back a response.
- **Access External Services**: APIs enable applications to interact with third-party services or data sources. For example, a weather app might use an API to fetch weather data from an external weather service.
- **Standardize Communication**: APIs provide a standardized way for different software components or systems to interact, regardless of their underlying technology.

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** and **GraphQL** are common API design styles. REST APIs use HTTP requests to interact with resources, while GraphQL allows clients to request specific data and aggregate results from multiple sources.

### **In Summary**

- **Frontend**: The user-facing part of a web application where users interact directly.
- **Backend**: The server-side part that processes data and handles the business logic.
- **API**: A set of rules that allows different software components to communicate and exchange data.

Together, these components work to create a complete web application, with the frontend providing the user experience, the backend managing data and logic, and the API facilitating communication between the two.

17.**HYPERVISIOR**

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is software or firmware that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) on a physical host system. It sits between the hardware and the operating systems, allowing multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on a single physical machine. 

![image alt](https://github.com/Gautam-io-dev/Basic-Computer-Science-Keywords/blob/242e0ad8637badf459f08e03bd2c6d5956dc901d/Image%2020.jpeg)

There are two main types of hypervisors:

1. **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-metal)**: This type runs directly on the host's hardware, without an underlying operating system. It manages the hardware resources and allocates them to the virtual machines. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.

2. **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted)**: This type runs on top of an existing operating system. It relies on the host OS to manage hardware resources and provides virtual machines with an interface to the host OS. Examples include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop.

Hypervisors are used for various purposes, including server virtualization, desktop virtualization, and in development and testing environments, enabling more efficient use of hardware resources and easier management of multiple operating systems.
